Other handy things:
* [Fist-to-5 Consensus-Based Decision Making](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vvjuKVqtvqt4EcuC3_cS4c3Yvm5ZUa1O5fIBR4iKjUg/edit?usp=sharing) presentation.  We have not started using this widely but are in the process of trialing it, to see if it works when normal discussion starts to drag on.
* All the webapps and mobile app projects at Hack for LA, should be ADA compliant.  We are an inclusive organization by charter.  Get acquainted with accessibility: https://www.ada.gov/pcatoolkit/chap5toolkit.htm

### If you are UX/UI/PM/Copywriter/Graphic Designer/Activist or other non coding professional

You are not only welcome, you are much needed in the development of software. Please connect with us in person at a hacknight or reach out to us in the [general](https://hackforla.slack.com/archives/C04502L0P) channel on slack.


### If you are Developer or Data Scientist

We make use of Docker for most of our projects, install it before you come for faster onboarding.  

You will need both Docker and Docker Compose.
The recommended installation method is [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms) for Windows 10 64-bit,
Mac, and Linux users. Users of unsupported operating systems may check out [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/) instead.

More on using Docker and the concepts of containerization:

* [Get started with Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/)
